                    <strong>Inside the dark</strong> is a dungeon-crawler game about exploring the dark dungeon. I did this project with a team of 3 people (Artem Urazovsky, Sergey Belmas, and Alexey Grabar), in which I was the leader and programmer. In the beginning, we developed this game specifically for the ITalent competition. We made the first version in literally two months and took the 5th absolute place nationally. We are still developing the game, but you can already watch the trailer and listen to some soundtrack from our composer Artem Urazovsky.

                    This project was one of my first steps in computer modeling and learning the Python programming language. Later, we made a visual shell for the project on the Unity engine. As a result, we had to make our library for drawing graphs.

                    a considerable part of it is the description of the ray path construction algorithm. 
                    For implementation, I used the C# programming language together with XNA and Unity engines.

                    I started composing problems about three years ago. 
                    During this time, I have accumulated a huge number of them, 
                    so I decided to collect them in one file. 
                    Some of them appeared at the city Kharkiv Olympiad,
                    and some I used in my tournament in Physics, Mathematics and English <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F7SFbgdHU_H8XMiI5o3xKesMT7u1uJk3?usp=sharing" id = "link-red">MPE</a>.

                    In this project, I implemented a Minecraft-like random world generation. In addition, I made
                    inventory system, simple AI and character stats. In the beginning, this 
                    project was focused on the Unity Asset Store (before that I published 
                    2 assets: a

                    Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to bring it to release.
